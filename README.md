# Overview

### My purpose here is to learn the basics of Java, and apply it to a simple, real world problem. 

This Software is simple in its execution. It asks for a measurement as input, the original unit type, and the desired unit type. 
It will then process the information, and display the converted measurement.

I wrote this code primarily as to practice my Java Coding, however it has its uses in any instance where quick unit conversion is needed

# Development Environment

I used most of the basic Java variables and operations. this included classes, loops, if/then statements, and try statements.

I used the Java Programming languages alongside the Objects library (used for comparing strings), 
the Scanner Library (used to receive user input), and the Array's Library to compare one string to an array of options.

# Future Work

* First, I need to fix an input issue. If the user types a number, it works fine, 
if they type in a letter, it will catch it, but if they type in numbers followed by a single letter, 
It will go through the code and have no issues. I don't know why this is, but I want to fix it.
* I would like to make a UI for this, and that will be the first step on my next module, app development.
* I would like to fix issues such as the one found in converting 100cm into meters, 
It displays it as 0.99999 something due to process of converting it to inches first.
